# 👋 Hi, I'm Akari

Software developer focused on **Android**, **Jetpack Compose**, **Kotlin**, and modern tools to build functional, smooth, and practical apps for everyday use. I also work with **Python** for automation, scraping, and personal tooling.

## 🚀 Android Development

### 🧱 Core stack
- **Kotlin**
- **Jetpack Compose** (declarative UI)
- **ViewModel + StateFlow** for robust state management
- **Room** for local persistence
- **Hilt** for dependency injection
- **Navigation** for clear and scalable flows
- **Coroutines + Flow** for concurrency

### ✨ What I like to build
- Fast, efficient, and reactive interfaces  
- **Complex reordering systems** with custom animations  
- Clean and scalable architecture patterns  
- Smooth integrations between UI ↔ ViewModel ↔ repositories

## ☁️ Synchronization & distributed databases

I’m interested in solving real-world multi-device synchronization problems.  
I’ve worked with:

- **Firestore** for remote and multi-device data  
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging** to notify devices about changes  
- **Firebase Storage** as an alternative for full backups and fast restores  

I explore patterns to reduce unnecessary reads and improve load times.

## 🧠 Python for useful tools

I use Python to automate tasks and build tools that complement my projects:

- Remote navigation with `Selenium`  
- File downloading and management  
- Personal scripts for daily workflow automation

## 🛠️ Technologies I use daily

**Android:**  
`Kotlin` · `Compose` · `ViewModel` · `Flow` · `Coroutines` · `Room` · `Hilt` · `Navigation` · `DataStore`

**Python:**  
`asyncio` · `Playwright` · `pydantic` · `selenium`

**Cloud:**  
`Firebase Firestore` · `Firebase Storage` · `FCM`

## 🎯 What I’m currently focused on

- Android apps that make my life easier  
- Improving patterns, structure, and code aesthetics  
- Writing cleaner, more modular, and reusable code  
- Building personal Python tools to speed up my own development

## 📩 Open to collaboration
Most of the time (when I’m not working on another project), I’m open to collaborating on modern Android projects, useful Python tools, or mobile apps that integrate AI.
